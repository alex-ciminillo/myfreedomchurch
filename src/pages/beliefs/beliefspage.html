                            created everything (John 1:3; Colossians 1:16). Therefore, He also owns and rules everything
                            (Psalm 103:19). That means He has authority over our lives and we owe Him absolute

                            True faith is
                            always accompanied by repentance
                            from
                            sin. Repentance is agreeing with God that you are sinful, confessing your sins to Him, and
                            making a conscious choice to turn from sin (Luke 13:3, 5; 1 Thessalonians 1:9), pursue
                            Christ
                            (Matthew 11: 28-30; John 17:3), and obey Him (1 John 2:3). It isn't enough to believe
                            certain
                            facts about Christ. Even Satan and his demons believe in the true God (James 2:19), but they
                            don't love and obey Him. True saving faith always responds in obedience (Ephesians 2:10).

                            We Believe Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day, and personally appeared to His disciples after His resurrection.
                            (1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Acts 1:3, Romans 4:25)

                            We Believe in the bodily ascension of Jesus to heaven, His exaltation and personal, literal and bodily coming again the second time for the Church.
                            (John 14:2-3, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18)


                            We Believe in the salvation of sinners by grace, through repentance and faith in the perfect and sufficient work of the cross of Christ by which we obtain remission of sins through His shed blood.
                            (Ephesians 2:8-9, Colossians 1:13-14, Hebrews 9:12, Romans 5:11)
