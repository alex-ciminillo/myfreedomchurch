                            product of evolution. But the Bible says we were created by a personal God to love, serve,
                            and enjoy endless fellowship with Him. The New Testament reveals it was Jesus Himself who
                            created everything (John 1:3; Colossians 1:16). Therefore, He also owns and rules everything
                            (Psalm 103:19). That means He has authority over our lives and we owe Him absolute
                            allegiance, obedience, and worship.</div>

                            There is no man who does not sin (1 Kings 8:46). That doesn't mean we're incapable of
                            performing
                            acts of human kindness. But we're utterly incapable of understanding, loving, or pleasing
                            God on
                            our own (Romans 3:10-12).</div>

                            punished by eternal death (Ezekiel 18:4; Romans 6:23). That's why simply changing our
                            patterns
                            of behavior can't solve our sin problem or eliminate its consequences.</div>

                            as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.
                            Even
                            though God's justice demands death for sin, His love has provided a Savior who paid the
                            penalty
                            and died for sinners (1 Peter 3:18). Christ's death satisfied the demands of God's justice,
                            and
                            Christ's perfect life satisfied the demands of God's holiness (2 Corinthians 5:21), thereby
                            enabling Him to forgive and save those who place their faith in Him (Romans 3:26).</div>

                            from
                            sin. Repentance is agreeing with God that you are sinful, confessing your sins to Him, and
                            making a conscious choice to turn from sin (Luke 13:3, 5; 1 Thessalonians 1:9), pursue
                            Christ
                            (Matthew 11: 28-30; John 17:3), and obey Him (1 John 2:3). It isn't enough to believe
                            certain
                            facts about Christ. Even Satan and his demons believe in the true God (James 2:19), but they
                            don't love and obey Him. True saving faith always responds in obedience (Ephesians 2:10).
